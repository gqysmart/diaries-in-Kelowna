It is 4th day in Canada. Waking up quite late, I have no specific aims today. I wish I could reduce the life speed. When I decided to IGA is the time of 2pm, I followed the map ,walking along the quiet road. The building along the road are quite beautiful. At that time, I thought it maybe good to live here if I have a regular income. There are few people in the road. A handsome young people riding a bike smiled to me, that let me feel the people here quite friendly.

The IGA is not far from the house where I'm living, small but cozy place. I picked a box of beef and a bottle of chocolate milk with 50% of discount. The server was friendly, saying hello to me, letting me feel friendly again. Then, I went back home, frying half of the beef with the leftover of rice. The food was quite delicious despite some beef old. After the meal, I felt quite sleepy, so I went up the stair to have a nap.

I decided to continue to learn the probability class of UCI Open. I am not sure that it maybe is useful for understanding AI.

The most important thing I did today is that I email to apply a job of Associated Engineering about an instrumentation and controls engineer or technologist. Although I receive an email response showing that they would consider another job position for me in the future, it is a good start. I think if I fulfill my resume, focusing on the requirement of those companies, I will get offers.

The day will end again...
