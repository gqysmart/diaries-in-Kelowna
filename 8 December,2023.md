In the whole day, I stayed in the house, watching some clips about probability and emailing a job application to be a BIM model. Sometimes, I feel frustrated, you know, I learned a lot of skills about CS and civil engineering, but I have to say that I cannot use them proficiently. For example, I have learned the major of civil engineering for 5year(bachelor) plus 2.5 years(master), but I spend too much time on administration and architectural design, which both are quite irrational. I worked in IT company and have achieved professional level, but I have no certification.

Sometimes, I think I am an opportunist, although I throw away all opportunities and flied to Canada alone at last. I need time to think clearly what professional way I will to take, full stack engineer or GPU and Game engineer, maybe else. Now my determination is for GPU because it is relevant to AI, although I still have a whole conception about AI, especially popular LLM. I know AR/MR can be a good way, that Robot is also a good direction, although I have no enough basic knowledge about hardware.

God bless me. The current stage task is to overcome the language barrier. I found the listening skill have improved a lot since I arrived at Canada, although I had not much chance to practice it. I will persist in writing diaries to improve my writing and thinking skills. The only skill I have not arranged to hone is speaking, and I have little time to talk to the shop clerk.

By the way, I woke up early at 7.30. It is a good sign since it indicate that I come to get used to the time zone of Canada.
The day is ending.
