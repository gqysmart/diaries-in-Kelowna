This is the second day when I lived in Kelowna. I planned to get up earlier, setting up an alarm clock at 7.30 am. However, when the alarm going off, I switched off it quickly as I was too tired then and slept again. About at 9.30 am, I woke up again, and dressed well, doing some cleaning.

This is the first day when I should go out alone to explore the new world, and the first thing I need to do is to take some food back. I remember the message that my tutor gave me last night in WeChat, which told me there is a Chinese supermarket in the vicinity of the house. I prepared my backpack, removing some redundant things to reduce the burden, so I can walk swiftly. Then, I went down the stair, put on my shoes and went out.

It seemed to be drizzling, so I put on my hood fast. I picked out my cell phone, opening the Google map app, and located the place "oriental supermarket", following the instruction of the app, turning left and going along Lester road. The supermarket is in a vehicle patio, a quite small place. When I arrived, I pushed the door and stepped into the supermarket, feeling nothing special. There were many fast food in the refrigerator, such as refrigerated meat ball and other hot pot materials. I had two targets here, the first is buying some food like bread and milk, and the second was to get some changes to take bus and have 50c$ to pay my receiver. I went around the supermarket, finding nothing I needed, even not seeing dairy section. Despite this, I still bought a bottle of water about $1.99 to get some changes. And at lest, I had the money to take a bus. After going out the supermarket, I continued to go along the sidewalk, orienting to the downtown. I don't know why I did that, maybe because then I thought there I could get every service.

The map prompted it was an 11.5 miles journey and about 1.5 hours walking. I walked on, and found quickly it was impossible ant that it was too easy to be tired, so I decided to look around the vicinity. On the map, Walmart was nearby, which is a quite familiar name in China, and I thought there may be some extra services in the supermarket. However, nothing but grocery was there, by the way, I watched some drug addicted young people there high. At last, I bought two Silk milk and a box of beef slice.

After going out of Walmart, I located a place to buy mobile card and the app prompt that there was a place named Roger's could do the service, which making me remind of the game of Diablo, a quite weak hero exploring the rogers' camp and lastly being a real hero. The location was not accurate, so I went around the near place several times and lastly found it hiding at a corner. When I walked in, the two service man/woman was quite busy, so I looked around the small place, hanging many phone-protect shells on the wall. Waiting for a long time, It came to my turn. Feeling a little nervous, I talked to the service woman, asking how to buy a Fido phone card. At first, it is difficult for me to listen clearly and speak clearly, but after a short term, I began to be familiar with the conversation, and started to like this style of talking. Although there were some problems with the visitor visa, I picked the number, a quite auspicious number with many 6 and 8, 238-338-1826. And I asked her to give me an e-sim card, so I can retain my Chinese phone number, which I can get some verifying information.

After finishing the phone number issue, I felt quite tired, so I decided to go back home to have a rest firstly. That is end of the morning of the day. I was an all mess because I had no plan before I went out. In the afternoon, I would plan well to a specific location to buy bus monthly ticket and bank account.
