Sitting down to write in my diary today, I realize ten days have passed since I last wrote here. During this time, I rent a room from a Frenchman named Sol, kind and quiet, just like me. While conversing with him, I discovered an App called Grammarly, which I found incredibly useful. Its AI function helps me organize my idea and express clearly and formally. It can provide sentences simple yet straightforward, and I aspire to master English like the App.

Speaking of my English study, I am gradually adapting to the environment here in Kelowna. I no longer feel like an alien in this new place. When I shop at markets, I feel I am just wandering at a Chinese supermarket. Today, I took a bus to Orchard Exchange to exchange Canadian Dollars. When speaking to the service woman, I noticed my voice sound more confident, slow and deep, even though I still could not understand everything she said. It is a positive sign.

Apart from learning English, I am also interested in building a career in 3D and AI. I plan to learn new technologies such as ThreeJS, Babylon, and Cesium to achieve the goal.

That is all for today in my diary.

===== I modified the above, following the suggestion of Grammarly.

Luckily, during the period, I rented a room from a French, whose name is Sol, quite a good guy, and quite like quiet, which may be suitable for me, you know, I am also like quiet. When I communicated with Sol, I found that the app Grammarly is quite useful. Every time I use the AI function to express my idea formally, and the sentence that it provided me is quite simple but clear. I wish I could master the language like it.

Fist thing I need to record is the process of my English study. After half a month I stayed in Kelowna, I begin to suit the environment, and never feel myself an alien here. When I shop in markets, I feel myself just wandering in a supermarket in China, freely. Today I took a bus to the Orchard Exchange to exchange some Canada Dollars. When I spoke to the service woman, the voice felt quite confident, though I still cannot understand what she said completely. It is a good augury.

Besides English learning, I want to make a scheme for my career, from 3D to AI, so I should learn many new technologies, such as Cesium/ThreeJs/Babylon.
